After switch to branch "firstbranch",
	#git branch -a	//list out all of the branches.
	#git checkout firstbranch	//switch to firstbranch. 

in the firstbranch I create this file "mytestfile2.txt".

after merge firstbranch to master branch.
___I modified in firstbranch: Hello mytestfile2 is modified
in firstbranch.
